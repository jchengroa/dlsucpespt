# DLSU Computer Engineering (CpE) Sutdent Progress Tracker

Welcome to the DOCSTRING of the project! 
Many students fail to monitor their academic standing due to delayed or missing grade updates on platforms like Instructure Canvas. 
This project aims to develop a Python-based console application that helps DLSU Computer Engineering students track their academic progress. 
The program uses the official ID124 flowchart to monitor subjects, compute GPA, and assess deanâ€™s list eligibility. 
It allows input of each course and GPA. Results show the system provides accurate and flexible tracking. 
This tool encourages early academic monitoring, helping students make informed decisions and avoid unexpected academic outcomes.
